/// ComputeService allows the creation, and management of compute instances.
/// Compute instances are micro-vm backed environments which boot very quickly
/// and are optimized to run containers.
/// ## Access
/// ComputeService is segregated into isolated regions for fault tolerance.
/// Each of the regional API endpoints offers a view into the compute instances
/// running at that location. Reach out to Namespace team at support@namespace.so
/// for a list of available regions.
/// ```
/// https://{region}.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
/// # E.g.:
/// https://eu.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
/// https://us.compute.namespaceapis.com:443
/// ```
/// See [the overview](https://buf.build/namespace/cloud) for examples accessing
/// the API from the console.
/// ## Authentication
/// Calls to the ComputeService require a *tenant token* or a *workload token*
/// passed as a Bearer token as part of each call. These are always required.
/// A *tenant token* identifies both the workspace that the call operates on, but
/// may also constrain the set of actions that the caller may do.
/// A *workload token* identifies a running instance, and the workspace it is
/// running in. Each running instance has a workload token, which is
/// automatically made available to services running inside the instance.
/// A *tenant token* can be obtained using the
/// [IAM API](https://buf.build/namespace/cloud/docs/main:namespace.cloud.iam.v1beta).
/// ## Guest services
/// Managed guest services such as docker that are deployed and managed by
/// Namespace are reachable using the corresponding standard APIs, through the
/// public internet.
/// Because these services typically don't support Namespace-based encapsulation,
/// a client-side proxy is used to transport the application-specific protocol
/// over the Namespace's public ingress, into the instance.
/// To facilitate communication, the main underlying mechanism to transport the
/// application-specific protocol is WebSockets over HTTPS.
/// ### Example: using the Docker API
/// To call the Docker API remotely, first obtain the Docker public endpoint by
/// querying the set of running Services, using the DescribeInstance call.
/// Iterate over `metadata.services` until finding an entry with `name=docker`.
/// Establish an HTTPS connection to the contained `endpoint`, and upgrade it to
/// a WebSocket. To authenticate your request include an authentication token
/// (see Authentication) in the `x-nsc-ingress-auth` header.
/// If connecting using a browser, where setting headers is not possible, you can
/// instead construct a URL using the base endpoint, and passing
/// `x-nsc-ingress-auth` as a query string argument.
/// After the WebSocket is established, any frames received or sent of type
/// BinaryMessage carry application-specific payload.

  /// Creates a new instance. Instances are micro-vm backed environments which
  /// are optimized to run containers. Each instance is deployed with
  /// `containerd`, and with optionally `dockerd` and Kubernetes.
  /// Instances can run one or more containers. Containers can be started using
  /// one of two mechanisms:
  /// - Namespace managed containers: containers are specified at creation time
  ///   via the `containers` field, or at runtime via the `StartContainers`
  ///   method. Managed containers have logs and metrics automatically
  ///   collected, and Namespace's infrastructure optimizes future startup time
  ///   of repeated use of the same containers. These containers are handled as
  ///   "critical" and their lifetime is tied to the VMs -- if they fail,
  ///   either due to early exit, OOM, etc, the instance also fails. Namespace
  ///   managed containers are always run on containerd directly, in the
  ///   `default` namespace.
  /// - User-managed containers: after an instance is created, you can use the
  ///   containerd or Docker APIs to create and manage containers yourself.
  ///   These containers are not marked required, so it's up to a user to take
  ///   action to terminate a VM on container failure.
  /// Instances that are running can be accessed via the region ingress.
  /// Endpoints per exposed service are returned as part of the instance
  /// creation. For example, proxies are exposed that allow direct access to
  /// `containerd`, `docker`, etc services which are usually only exposed over
  /// Unix sockets.
  /// The creation of an instance produces a set of metadata: InstanceMetadata
  /// is also available in ListInstances requests, but the remainder of
  /// metadata (e.g. extended metadata) is only available at creation time, or
  /// if DescribeInstance is called.
  /// Instance creation is non-blocking. After an instance is created call
  /// WaitInstance to observe the states instance creation goes through.
  /// ### Errors
  /// - If the workspace is out of resources, a `ResourceExhausted` status is
  ///   returned.
  /// - If the request refers to an invalid argument, e.g. a non-existing
  ///   region, an `InvalidArgument` status is returned.
